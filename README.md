# GlipBank
Tool that gives you all the past conversations from your glip account

So far there is nothing really.

This programme is supposed to take all the past conversations you had on your glip account. And store them into txt file.

Problems so far:
  Open all the conversations there can be and then scan then?
  How to get to the beggining of a really long conversation?
